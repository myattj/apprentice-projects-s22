Central repository for App Team Carolina's Academy Apprenticeship projects in Spring 2022.

## Setting up your projects repository
  1. Open the [repository](https://github.com/appteamcarolina/apprentice-projects-s22) on the GitHub website.

  2. [Fork](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo) this repository to create your own copy. This will let you push your code onto GitHub without changing the starter code.
  
  > A fork is a copy of a repository. Forking a repository allows you to freely experiment with changes without affecting the original project.

  3. Clone this repository into a folder that contains all of your App Team Carolina files.

      **Note:** You can do this through Xcode or in the Terminal.

  4. Now, you have a local copy of your forked version of the projects repository.


## Working on and submitting a project
  1. During development, commit your changes on your local machine.

  2. After committing, push them to your remote, forked projects repository.

  3. In the `README.md` file of each project, add a screenshot or gif of your completed project.
